		sort of discipline, it&#39;s not any kind of eating habits or the ability to get
		up early. No, it&#39;s simply just the fact that I can walk for a long time
		without feeling tired or hurt. It is a useful if unexciting ability. I&#39;ve
		been wanting to get more into walking and then transition to proper hiking
		for a long time. Yesterday I finally took the first <it>step</it> towards that
		goal.</p> <p>Walking is nice. I&#39;ve always quite liked walking and being out in nature.
		Though I&#39;m not at the point where nature alone feels like quite enough
		stimulation so you better believe that I was wearing headphones and
		listening to podcasts the whole time cause I need that sweet, sweet
		stimulation. Still, walking is nice.</p> <h2>Might as well</h2> <p>I live in Switzerland and even as someone who has spent his whole life in
		this country, the beauty and especially the close proximity of nature in
		this country isn&#39;t lost on me. There are many beautiful places around the
		world but Switzerland, with it&#39;s excellent public transport and its
		extensive network of hiking trails, is certainly among the best suited for
		the hobby of hiking.</p> <p>It is fantastic how easy it is here to just &quot;go for a walk&quot;. People in
		Switzerland, Germany and Austria are already known to enjoy the pastime of
		walking and it&#39;s no wonder that we do. The cities are mostly very walkable
		and nature is never that far away. Suburbs are mostly not a thing because
		most of the landscape is split up into small villages that are never more
		than 30min to 1h away on foot. Getting lost is near impossible as well, as
		you can usually just walk until you find the next village, bus stop or even
		train station. Add to that the fact that all the walking and hiking trails
		are very easy to navigate thanks to clear signage. More on that later.</p> <h2>Give me a sign!</h2> <p>I already quickly brought up signs but I want to go into a little bit more
		detail when it comes to signage here in Switzerland as far as hiking trails
		are concerned. Switzerland is riddled with official hiking trails. That in
		itself isn&#39;t special. Many countries have hiking trails. But what I think is
		somewhat unique is how well those trails are labeled. Here, a hiking trail
		will always have yellow signage along its path. There are a selection of
		different variations. The most information you&#39;ll find is when trails cross
		over. At those crossings, the signs will often not only point to the
		different directions where the trails continue, but they will also show you
		the village the trail leads to, along with the amount of time in hours and
		minutes that it&#39;ll take you to get that are a normal walking pace. The
		second type is similar but without that time or destination information. It
		simply points in the direction the trail continues when there are crossing
		paths. The last type are signs and markings along the trails when there are
		not crossings. Those only exist to indicate to you that you are still
		walking along a trail and have not strayed of the path.</p> <p>Here are some examples that I actually encountered on my walk. First just
		the sign you will find to indicate that you are still on the trail.</p> <img src="/blogimg/231023_img/sign.jpg" alt="trail marking sign" class="landscape blog-img"> <p>This one here shows the path taking a turn.</p> <img src="/blogimg/231023_img/arrowsign.jpg" alt="trail marking sign with arrows showing direction" class="landscape blog-img"> <p>Lastly one that is like the first, but here just painted on a tree in the
		forest.</p> <img src="/blogimg/231023_img/treemarking.jpg" alt="trail marking sign on tree" class="landscape blog-img"> <h2>Departure</h2> <p>Sunday the 22nd of October, 9AM. I get up! Having picked out my route and
		prepared food for sandwiches, I feel ready to go. After preparing the
		sandwiches and finishing my usual morning coffee, I get fully dressed, pack
		my backpack and go outside.</p> <p>The route that I picked is a bit over 12km and I plan to be out for about 4h
		total. That leaves me with more than enough time for the distance as well as
		the included lunch break.</p> <p>Soon after I get to the trail, I&#39;m already met with quite a nice path that
		crosses a field. I&#39;m still getting familiar with the area and it&#39;s always
		nice to find new spots.</p> <img src="/blogimg/231023_img/fieldpath.jpg" alt="trail marking sign on tree" class="landscape blog-img"> <h2>Entering the forest and lunch</h2> <p>After about 30min of walking, I enter the forest. The trail up until this
		point was mostly going uphill but the incline was pretty shallow. At this
		point, I&#39;ve gained about 100m in altitude over a few kilometers of walking.
		My plan is unchanged and I still intend to enter the forest and walk until I
		hit the halfway point of the trail and also the highest point of the whole
		journey. The point I plan to have my lunch. The temperature is about 14C at
		this point but the forest feels noticeably colder than when I was walking
		under the clear sky. The absence of the sun makes all the difference.
		Despite it feeling <it>colder</it> I still don&#39;t feel cold. It&#39;s honestly the
		perfect temperature for walking as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p> <p>I make it to my intended lunch spot at around 11:40AM. Originally I thought
		I&#39;d get a better view judging from the map because right north of my current
		location, there&#39;s a pretty steep drop in terrain and I was hoping that I
		would have a nice view once I got here. But it turns out that the trees
		block all the view from here and I didn&#39;t feel like straying too far of the
		trail in hopes of a view that might or might not be there. In fact, I
		already stayed a little bit to find this lunch spot in the first place. Only
		a few hundred meters.</p> <img src="/blogimg/231023_img/lunch.jpg" alt="trail marking sign on tree" class="portrait blog-img"> <h2>The way back and losing to the fear of blisters</h2> <p>After lunch, I get on my way to continue on the trail. Having walked just
		over half the total distance, my stamina is doing totally fine. But the same
		thing can&#39;t be said for my feet. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not wearing hiking shoes
		because I currently don&#39;t own any good ones. I&#39;m wearing my normal everyday
		shoes and I&#39;m starting to feel some blisters that might develop on my left
		foot. Being confronted with the decision to either finish my walk at the
		cost of my foot or give up and take the train back, the choice is clear.
		Luckily the train station is along the way. Before I get to it there is a
		few kilometers of walking down a pretty steep decline. Not the easiest thing
		with my current foot situation but I manage it.</p> <p>After a train ride, I arrive home. My feet hurting a little but intact. No
		blisters to be seen. I&#39;m looking forward to the next one.</p></article>`;
