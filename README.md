# Yves' Webdev Playground
A space for me to try things out. Currently hosted on [playground.yvesbruckmayer.com](https://playground.yvesbruckmayer.com) using Svelte as a framework and Netlify as a host.

## Current state
Currently there's only a homepage and a skeleton of a blog on this page.

## The source code
Everything I do here will be open source so that people can look at it. I'm only just learning Svelte and this repo being open will also be helpful toward that end.
