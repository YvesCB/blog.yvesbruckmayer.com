<h1>This is where you'll find me posting random things</h1>
<p>
	I'm using this page as a little blog where I'm just gonna write about stuff.
	Whatever stuff I wanna write about in the moment. Could be about programming
	or about me taking a walk. Doesn't matter.

<BlogTitle

	I went on a 10km walk/hike. Took some pictures and enjoyed the day. You can
	read more by clicking the title or image.
