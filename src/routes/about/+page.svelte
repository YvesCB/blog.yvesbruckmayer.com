<h1>What is all this?</h1>

<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>
	This page is just what the name implies; a playground for me to try out <it
		>webdev</it
	>
	related stuff. Currently this page is implemented with
	<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> because it's a framework I like
	so far and one I wanted to keep toying with.
</p>

<h3>Fonts used</h3>
<p>I'm using 2 fonts on this site currently:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		For English: <a
			href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans?query=playpen"
			>Playpen Sans</a
		>
	</li>
	<li>
		For Japanese: <a
			href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kosugi+Maru?query=kosugi+maru"
			>Kosugi Maru</a
		>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of those fonts are from Google fonts.</p>

<p>
	A little JP test: <span class="jp"
		>こんにちは皆さん。こちらの<b>日本語</b>をご覧ください。</span
	>
</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
	Hi, I'm Yves and I made this site and I'll be the one to maintain it. For how
	long? I don't know for how long I will do that but we shall see. I'm in my
	late twenties when writing this in 2023 and I'm working in the IT industry. In
	my free time I enjoy recreational programming, reading and learning Japanese
	and working out.
