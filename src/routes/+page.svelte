<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
	This is my Homepage/Playground. I'm just gonna put a bunch of stuff here. This
	site was made with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>. I'm by no
	means a Svelte Guru but it's a framework I quite it, enjoy because of how
	simple it can be to use if you choose not to do anything too crazy with it.
	It's basically just <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> with some extra features at its
	very simplest.
</p>

<p>
	I'm gonna use this as a sort of <a href="/blog">blog</a> for myself and I'm
	also gonna be linking to some friends in the <a href="/friends">friends</a> section
	of this page. It's other people that have recently (as of October 2023) been making
	some websites.
